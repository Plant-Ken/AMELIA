<h1>Amelia personality</h1>
<p> When Amelia was about 3 years old she was a very out going child. As time pass she grew to be very quiet. Due to her village being ruthless and rude to her she decide she was all alone. So she moved out of her original home and decided to move into the abandon church that she found wandering. Now she is quiet and shy. But when she is at her peak of her happiness she cooks a fantastic meal.<p>
